      <h1 style="color: white">History of the Indian cricket team</h1>
      <p style="color: white">
        The Indian cricket team made its Test cricket debut in 1932 and has
        since advanced to be among the top four test teams in the (ICC rankings)
        in each of 2005 to 2008.[1] The team won the ODI Cricket World Cup in
        1983 and 2011.[2] In other major International victories, Team India won
        the Twenty20 World Cup in 2007[3] and ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 and
        2013.[4] <br> Cricket was introduced to India by European merchant sailors in
        the 18th century, and the first cricket club was established in 1792.
        India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25
        June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket
        status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its
        first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket,
        India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test
        matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with
        the emergence of players such as Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the
        Indian spin quartet. <br> India won its first World Cup in 1983, under the
        captaincy of Kapil Dev.[5] The '80s and '90s also saw the debut of
        Tendulkar,[6] Ganguly, Dravid, and Kumble, considered to be among the
        greatest Indian players. Ganguly's, captaincy is considered to be the
        turning point of Indian cricket as it saw great success and became one
        of the dominant side of the sport, followed by the superb captaincy of
        MS Dhoni under whom India won its second World Cup in 2011,[7] the
        inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007,[8] and Champions Trophy in 2013.[9]
        Currently, Virat Kohli is the captain in the Test format, while Rohit
        Sharma captains the ODI and T20I teams. <br>
